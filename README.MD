##README

This file explains how to run the file run_analysis.R 
to obtain a tidy dataset for the accelerometer data

The file only runs in the computer it was written on, because it writes the
zipped dataset on a local file, and reads all information from there.

To reproduce the analysis, run all lines in order form the top to the bottom
